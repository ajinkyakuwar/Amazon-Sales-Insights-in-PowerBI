Overview
This project aims to analyze Amazon sales data using Excel for data transformation, Power BI for visualization, and DAX measures for analysis. The goal is to gain insights into sales performance and trends, enabling informed decision-making.

Project Steps
Data Collection: The Amazon sales data was collected and stored in an Excel file format.

Data Transformation: Various data transformation techniques were applied to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency.

Data Analysis: Using Power BI, the dataset was imported and analyzed. DAX measures were implemented to calculate key metrics such as sales revenue, profit margins, and top-selling products.

Visualization: An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize the analyzed data. The dashboard includes dynamic visualizations such as charts, graphs, and slicers to facilitate easy exploration of sales trends and patterns.

Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, insights were drawn regarding sales performance, seasonal trends, and product profitability. These insights can be used to make data-driven decisions for optimizing sales strategies and improving overall business performance.
